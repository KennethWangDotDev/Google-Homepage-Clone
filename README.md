#Google Homepage Clone


This exercise was inspired by [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/). The goal of cloning Google's relatively simple home page was to practice my HTML/CSS skills while paying extra attention to to maintaining industry-standard coding conventions.


The entire exercise took me ~1.5 hours from start to finish. I found it relatively easy, and am pleased with the end result. It is by no means a pixel-perfect or functionally perfect duplication, since that was not the point of this.

As an aside, this was my first project done using SublimeText 3 with a bunch of plugins, and I am loving it so far. Bonus: this is also my first time using Git's command line. I managed to install and configure the SublimeText Git Plugin and it works beautifully.
